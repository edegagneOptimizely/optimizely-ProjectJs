## PJS-Scrolling Metrics
These javascript functions will check scroll depth and raise an Optimizely custom event for specified scoll depths.

Place the javascript in project js. Then create the following four (4) custom events:
- Scroll 25 (scroll25)
- Scroll 50 (scroll50)
- Scroll 50 (scroll75)
- Scroll 50 (scroll100)

These events will be available globally to use as instrumentation metrics in any campaigns or experiments.
