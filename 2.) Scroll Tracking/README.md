## PJS-Scrolling Metrics
These javascript functions will check scroll depth and send an Optimizely custom event for specific scroll depths.

To use, place the javascript in your project js. Then, create the following four (4) custom events:

- Name: Scroll 25, Key: scroll25
- Name: Scroll 50, Key: scroll50
- Name: Scroll 75, Key: scroll75
- Name: Scroll 100, Key: scroll100

These events will be available globally to use as instrumentation metrics in any campaign or experiment.
